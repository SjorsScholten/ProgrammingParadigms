# Emerging Trends Plan

## What is the chosen topic?

The emerging trend I want to research this semester is Programming Paradigms. During my time working on game development projects, I have come across mentions of different paradigms such as Data Oriented Programming and Functional Programming. I have gone deeper into these topics, but never have done concrete research.

## Questions:

- What is a Programming Paradigm?
- What Programming Paradigms are out there?
- What are the differences and benefits of using one paradigm over another? 
- When would you use a certain Paradigm?
- What languages support each Paradigm?
- What tools or frameworks are available for each paradigm? 
- How does a developer get to work in a paradigm?

## Plan
| what | type | deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain research | Literature study | a research document |
| Create a small application in one or more programming paradigms | Proof of concept | application |
