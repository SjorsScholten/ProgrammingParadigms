## Discuss the case

For me a Programming Paradigm is a specific notation pattern to structure a program. In Object Oriented Design (OOD), the developer will make a model of a real life example using Objects. In Data Oriented Design (DOD), the developer will take a data first approach and will work with Data Tables. There is no such thing as Objects in DOD, so you often see that polymorphism is not necessary.

- What is a Programming Paradigm?
- What Programming Paradigms are out there?
- What are the benefits of each Paradigm?
- When would you use a certain Paradigm?
- What languages support each Paradigm?

**What are Programming Paradigms?** </br>
a specific notation pattern to structure a program.

</br>

**What Programming Paradigms are out there?** </br>
Sofar I have heard of the following paradigms:
- Object Oriented
- Data Oriented
- Functional
- Procedural

</br>

**What are the benefits of each paradigm?**
- *Object Oriented* is one of the most used paradigms and the first paradigm you will mostly learn.
- *Data Oriented* is really fast with processing lots of (similar) data because it is tightly packed in memory.
- *Functional* is one of the easier to test since every function is responsible for one thing.

</br>

**When would you use a certain paradigm?**
- *Data Oriented Design* is useful when you need to have your data tightly packed in memory, and need to iterate a lot over a type of data

## What are Programming Paradigms?

The term programming paradigm refers to a style of programming (link). It can also refer to a way to classify programming languages based on their features (link).

Imperative paradigms are styles where the programmer instructs to change its state (i.e. Procedural and Object-Oriented). Imperative paradigms have 2 main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects.

Declarative paradigms are styles where the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it (i.e. Functional). In contrast to imperative paradigms, declarative paradigms do not state the order in which to execute operations

### Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is a paradigm based on procedures. a procedure is a series of computational steps to be carried out. Procedural programming uses a linear or top-down approach.

### Object Oriented Programming

### Functional Programming

A function always produces the same output given the same input. The code cannot change the input or introduce side effects on the application.

- 1st class functions, no side effects
- immutable data
